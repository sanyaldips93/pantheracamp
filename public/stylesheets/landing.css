/*The animation will be named imageAnimation, which matches with the value from our animation property in the .slideshow (unordered list) rule

From 0% to 10% (the beginning of our animation) the list item begins changing it's opacity from 0 to 1 (invisible to visible)
the animation-timing-function is set to ease-in at 0% and ease-out and 10%, this makes for a more smooth fade-in 
The list item's opacity then stays at 1 until it reaches 20% at which point it fades back out, reaching 0 at 30% and staying at 0 for the remainder of the animation
If we have 5 background images visible for 5 seconds each, then the time it takes to fade the image in and keep it visible is 10 seconds with a 5 second crossfade/fadeout into the next image;
The entire animation cycle for all 5 images takes 50 seconds total
100% divided by 5 is 20% so each image's fadein and visibility should last 20% of the cycle; half of 20% is 10%, that is why our fade in is from 0% to 10%, then we keep it visible until 20% is reached and begin the fadeout from 20% to 30%, the 5 second fadeout overlaps the next image's 5 second fadein, which is what creates the crossfade effect*/
